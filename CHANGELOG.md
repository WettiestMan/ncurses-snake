# Versions of ncurses-snake project

- Version 0.3.0.1

Fixed the snake being able to bite itself if it tried to go to his back when its body was more than
1 character long.

- Version 0.3.0.0

The game is almost ready for its 1.0 version, fixed tail not being updated correctly and
fixed keyboard input being waited for instead of being read on the fly.

Points are now being registered and added a "Game Over" screen.

- Version 0.2.0.0

Now you can see an actual snake that you can control here (tail is not getting updated properly)


- Version 0.1.0.0

No gameplay, only ncurses showing a box and a (buggy as hell) exit screen using the
SIGINT signal
