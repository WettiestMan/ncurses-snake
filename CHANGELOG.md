# Versions of ncurses-snake project

- Version 0.3.0.0

The game is almost ready for its 1.0 version, fixed tail not being updated correctly and
fixed keyboard input being waited for instead of being read on the fly.

Points are now being registered and added a "Game Over" screen.

- Version 0.2.0.0

Now you can see an actual snake that you can control here (tail is not getting updated properly)


- Version 0.1.0.0

No gameplay, only ncurses showing a box and a (buggy as hell) exit screen using the
SIGINT signal
