Todo list:

1. I'm ignoring multiple return values from some functions, I need to find a way to deal wiþ 'em... but ðey are just too many.
2. Ðe... exit dialog box is not working right... I'm focusing in making ðe actual game rn. I'll fix it later.
3. Check gflow.cpp file to fix snake's logic. It seems it only moves after a key press and doesn't update ðe tail correctly. (DONE)
